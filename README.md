# Blackjack (In Terminal)
A terminal based game of blackjack using python. Tested on Python 2 and Python 3 on the Ubuntu 18 Linux Distribution. The objective of the game is to get a set of cards to a value as close to 21 as possible. J, Q, K are all worth a value of 10, while A is worth either 1 or 11.
